## What is a Hacker?

Hacking is a mindset, not a skillset.

As defined by the [Internet Users’ Glossary](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1392), a hacker is “a person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.”

## The Hacker Attitude

1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.
2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.
4. Freedom is good.
5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.

"When a system forces you to break the law or the rules to solve a problem, that system has become the problem."
